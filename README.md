Social Buzz - Client README
Overview
Social Buzz is a social media and content creation company founded in 2010 by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate. They developed a new platform where content is at the center stage. The company has grown exponentially, and now they have over 500 million active users each month.

Social Buzz has requested the services of our advisory firm to help them manage and analyze their data, to learn data best practices, and to prepare them for their Initial Public Offering (IPO) scheduled for next year.

This README document outlines the client's background, requirements, and the tasks to be delegated.

Client Background
Social Buzz's founders started the company to capitalize on their previous employer's foundation and create a new platform where content took center stage. Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous and only tracking user reactions to every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds.

Social Buzz has scaled quicker than anticipated and needs the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively. Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect, and must analyze is huge.

Audit of their big data practice
